# How are ThreeFold tokens valued relative to farming capacity

There are several aspects to this question:

## Question

If the token value relative to fiat currency “floats” on the open speculative market, then its value can change rapidly by large amounts. The value of capacity in terms of fiat currency will fluctuate correspondingly unless the cost of internet capacity in tokens is also allowed to float.  If not, then if the speculative market for tokens drives the price up, the ThreeFold internet capacity could rapidly become more expensive than that of the current cloud providers. Will internet capacity in tokens be allowed to float?

## Answer

The mechanism here is as follows:
 - Token value is determined by demand and supply on token markets
 - ThreeFold grid capacity pricing is _set_ by Farmers in **fiat** currency.

 Therefore the farmer can set his capacity pricing against the global market / competitors.  This is done in the (local) fiat currency.  When reserving Grid capacity on the grid the total pricing for reserved capacity will be calculated (week, month, quarter of annual) and translated against the current token value.  The amount of tokens required to reserve the same capacity might vary based on the token value.   A higher token value provides you more ThreeFold capacity purchase power.  A lower price result in lesser.

## Question

The information we have seems to indicate that individual farmers set the price of their own capacity.  Do they set a price in terms of tokens, or in terms of fiat currency?  Either way, how do fluctuations impact the business of the farmers?

Farmer set their own pricing in **fiat** currency.  Capacity reservations are paid for in token so a higher value of the token will provide them with less tokens than when there is a lower token value.  Farmers have the freedom to change tokens to fiat when they believe they need to get fiat for business reasons or might sit on tokens to let them appreciate.

## Question

If the token price relative to fiat currency fluctuates rapidly, how do the small-scale farmers in particular regulate the cost of their capacity?  It seems to me that it would be very useful if there were a baseline price for farming capacity that is somehow automatically adjusted by the ThreeFold OS to follow a constant price relative to fiat currency in order to allow farmers to have a “hands-off” management of their own capacity. Then it might be useful to allow farmers to set the price of their capacity in terms of a multiplicative factor times this baseline price.

There is baseline pricing for farmers.  For farmers that have no idea or do not want to get involved in setting pricing for their capacity there is a defults pricing options set in the TF Grid.  As discussed before - capacity pricing is set in fiat and therefore no adjustment is needed when token pricing fluctuates.

## Question

How would an application that is intended for a mobile device negotiate prices with the various ThreeFold farmers as it roams around? This situation especially would require some automatic system-wide pricing.  It will be nearly impossible for a provider to negotiate individually with thousands (or eventually millions) of individual farmers.

## Answer

The TreeFold grid will have a directory (TF Directory) that allows current and future user to search capacity based on search criteria.  The search criteria are still have to be defined but will include things like:

 - cloud unit pricing
 - capacity geo-location
 - the service level guaranteed and achieved
 - some form of feedback on the performance of the farmers capacity used by others

## Question

How does this model lead to an increase in the value of tokens over time, especially if consumers decide to buy from whomever is offering the cheapest capacity?

## Answer

The value of the token will increase by the token being traded in token markets. The normal demand and supply mechanism will determine the token pricing. As the supply is only driven by Farmers that put capacity online and the demand is driven by a lot of different groups:
 - people that need tokens to reserve
