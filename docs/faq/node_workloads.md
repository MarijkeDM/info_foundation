# Do larger nodes perform different functions than SoHo nodes?

## Question

Do the small “household” nodes perform a different function from the larger configurations?

## Answer

Nope - SoHo nodes run Zero-OS and represent a (lot) smaller number of cloud units than the larger configurations. They will have a smaller number of applications running on it due to limited resources, but they might be part of a super resilient storage solution.

As an example of how SoHo nodes can be used to build a large virtual datacenter consider a telecommunications operator that has in a large number of cities fibre to the home. What if they consider putting a SoHo machine into each and every home that purchased their internet connectivity. Many commercial models can be deployed for this, the farmed tokens can be given as a discount to the telcos customer, the telco customer could be given an amount of storage capacity free of charge etc etc.  The telco would then have a distributed pool of capacity on which services can be build and run.
