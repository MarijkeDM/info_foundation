# Internet versus Cloud?

## Question

The precise role Threefold will play in the entire internet system needs more clarification. ThreeFold is often labeled as “the new internet”, but from what we understand it is more specifically a new cloud technology. The “internet” is the system of connections and routers (and more powerful core routers) that direct packets of information to their intended destination.  In addition to the system of routers and local connections, there is a system of high-speed, long-haul data pipelines (“highways”) called the internet “backbone”.  We understand that ISPs host and pay for maintaining the routing and data transfer infrastructure, hence charge their clients for this service.  Does ThreeFold not only provide an alternative to cloud computing, but also provide some routing service?  If not, is that an area where the ThreeFold grid could improve on its efficiency and speed?

## Answer

You are right - the original term internet is short for inter(connected) net(works).  This is how it all started - independent networks decided to interconnect (for free).  The purpose of interconnecting networks is to make information available to a wide group (both in numbers and in geo locations) of people.  

So information is stored somewhere and people want to that information. So the original term internet was all about interconnecting networks but the actual purpose for doing that was to allow people to access content.  What would the current internet be without any content?  A network is only able to transport transient messages from source to destination - a means of communications.

What we mean with “internet” today is the total construct of a _lot_ of information stored in network accessible locations.  Therefore the ThreeFold Grid will present new _internet_ capacity to the world.

On top of this cloud technology has a specific connotation to it as technology capable of running applications centrally.  As we are building a complete decentralised grid of capacity we would like to stay away from calling it cloud not not have that centralised connotation.  However (and this might complicate this answer) our decentralised grid _is_ able to run the same applications and all the existing and established cloud providers.
