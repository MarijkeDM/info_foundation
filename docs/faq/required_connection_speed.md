# What is the required connection speed for Farming?

## Question

Will high-speed connections be essential to the ThreeFold nodes, even small individually-owned ones? That is, is there only a very a limited utility for home-based ThreeFold nodes unless they have a very high connection speed? If so, it is important to quantify their minimum useful connection speed?

## Answer

Yes and No. The connection speeds can in theory be anything and the further we reach out and go to the edge the lower the available connection speed will be.  We have not yet collected any real life data and once more Farmers are up and running we will start to collect and present this data.

A good rule of thumb is that for home based (small) nodes 10 Mbps and up is a good starting point and for larger installations 100 Mbps and up is good.  Obviously these numbers are available and affordable (!) in Europe, USA, and some areas in Asia but not everywhere.  For other parts of the world we might end up with much lower connection speeds or even alternative networking technologies for example [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi) or others.
