# How will the ThreeFold Grid be implemented in emerging markets?

## Question

The places where ThreeFold is most needed are under-served regions that typically have minimal access to internet, if they have any access at all. In these locations it would be necessary to improve the internet infrastructure first, i.e. more and better routers and backbone. Furthermore, electric power is not reliable in these locations, compounding the problem of establishing a reliable ThreeFold Grid there. Are there ideas on how to surmount these challenges?

## Answer

A lot of ideas - none of them have been executed yet. ThreeFold Foundation has been speaking with other start-ups and companies that are actually rolling out local mobile and fixed networks. Companies are actually investing a lot in these areas to bring mobile connectivity and data and we should be speaking to the telecom operators and see how we can work with them to deploy internet connectivity to these homes and users or to work with the operator to deploy capacity in the telecommunication operators infrastructure.
